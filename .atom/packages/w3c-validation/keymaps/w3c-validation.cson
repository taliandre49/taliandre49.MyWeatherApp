# With the success of Atom, it's really difficult to choose keybindings that
# will not enter in conflict whit anyone else's packages, so I let this file
# empty to set your own keybindings.
# For you informations, here's an exemple of my keybindings for w3c-validation

# '.platform-linux atom-text-editor:not([mini]), .platform-win32 atom-text-editor:not([mini])':
#   'ctrl-alt-g': 'w3c-validation:validate'
#
# '.platform-darwin atom-text-editor:not([mini])':
#   'cmd-alt-g': 'w3c-validation:validate'
